# INTERACTIVE-QUIZ-APPLICATION

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

The Interactive Quiz Application is a browser-based quiz platform developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to offer users a fun and engaging way to test their knowledge across various subjects. The main goal of this project is to provide an interactive, user-friendly quiz system with real-time feedback, score tracking, and a clean, modern interface.

This application allows users to answer a series of 20 multiple-choice questions. Each question comes with four options, out of which only one is correct. The user interface is clean and simple, making it easy to use even for beginners. The project uses HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for all interactivity and dynamic behavior.

At the top of the quiz card, the title "Interactive Quiz Application" is displayed prominently. Below it, a progress bar fills up as the user moves through the quiz, giving a clear visual indicator of how many questions have been answered. On the same row, the timer shows how many seconds have passed since the quiz started, and the current score updates live based on the userâ€™s performance.

Each question is displayed in a card format, such as:
"What is the result of len('Python')?"
This is followed by four answer options. When a user selects an option, the system instantly highlights the correct answer in green and the wrong ones in red, providing immediate feedback. This real-time validation helps users learn from their mistakes as they go, without needing to wait until the end of the quiz.

After selecting an answer, the "Next" button becomes active, allowing users to proceed to the next question. This button is styled in a vibrant orange color to make it stand out and guide user navigation clearly. Once all 20 questions are answered, a final screen appears, showing a congratulatory message:
"Quiz Finished!"
It also displays the user's final score, for example:
"Your final score is 11 out of 20."
This is followed by a "Restart" button, which allows the user to retake the quiz from the beginning. This feature is useful for those who want to practice repeatedly and improve their performance.

The use of CSS transitions and color indicators adds to the interactive feel of the application. The background uses a soft gradient, making the interface look smooth and pleasant. All elements are neatly aligned, ensuring a professional appearance.

From a technical perspective, JavaScript is responsible for rendering questions dynamically, capturing user input, validating answers, updating the score, and handling the timer. The codebase is modular and easy to maintain or expand.

This project can be further improved by adding categories, difficulty levels, user login functionality, and saving scores using local storage or a database. It could even be adapted into a mobile-friendly app using frameworks like React or Vue.js in the future.

In summary, the Interactive Quiz Application is a lightweight, educational tool created using basic web development technologies. It is simple to use, visually appealing, and provides a great foundation for more complex quiz systems.
